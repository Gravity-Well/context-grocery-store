Simple Grovery shopping. Initially a Salad maker.

Needs to be refactored for that (by me not students)

Demonstrates Redux like pattern use of Context API.

TO DO: Not critical for Context example but for students to add

1. Logout/purchase feature.

2. Refactory Salad Context to follow Redux pattern.

3. Don't allow duplicate items

4. Show prices

5. Show quantity desired.
